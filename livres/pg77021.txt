FOREWORD


On the assumption that my technique is either complicated or original
or both, the publishers have politely requested me to write an
introduction to this book.

At least my theory of technique, if I have one, is very far from
original; nor is it complicated. I can express it in fifteen words,
by quoting The Eternal Question And Immortal Answer of burlesk, viz.
“Would you hit a woman with a child?--No, I’d hit her with a brick.”
Like the burlesk comedian, I am abnormally fond of that precision which
creates movement.

If a poet is anybody, he is somebody to whom things made matter very
little--somebody who is obsessed by Making. Like all obsessions, the
Making obsession has disadvantages; for instance, my only interest in
making money would be to make it. Fortunately, however, I should prefer
to make almost anything else, including locomotives and roses. It is
with roses and locomotives (not to mention acrobats Spring electricity
Coney Island the 4th of July the eyes of mice and Niagara Falls) that
my “poems” are competing.

They are also competing with each other, with elephants, and with El
Greco.

Ineluctable preoccupation with The Verb gives a poet one priceless
advantage: whereas nonmakers must content themselves with the merely
undeniable fact that two times two is four, he rejoices in a purely
irresistible truth (to be found, in abbreviated costume, upon the title
page of the present volume.)

                                          E. E. Cummings.

FIVE AMERICANS


I. LIZ

    with breathing as (faithfully) her lownecked
    dress a little topples and slightly expands

    one square foot mired in silk wrinkling loth
    stocking begins queerly to do a few
    gestures to death,
                      the silent shoulders are both
    slowly with pinkish ponderous arms bedecked
    whose white thick wrists deliver promptly to
    a deep lap enormous mindless hands.
    and no one knows what (i am sure of this)
    her blunt unslender, what her big unkeen

    “Business is rotten” the face yawning said

    what her mouth thinks of
                            (if it were a kiss
    distinct entirely melting sinuous lean . . .
    whereof this lady in some book had read


II. MAME

    she puts down the handmirror. “Look at” arranging
    before me a mellifluous idiot grin
    (with what was nose upwrinkled into nothing
    earthly, while the slippery eyes drown
    in surging flesh). A thumblike index down-
    dragging yanks back skin “see” (i, seeing, ceased
    to breathe). The plump left fist opening
    “wisdom.” Flicker of gold. “Yep. No gas. Flynn”

    the words drizzle untidily from released
    cheeks “I’ll tell duh woild; some noive all right.
    Aint much on looks but how dat baby ached.”

    and when i timidly hinted “novocaine?”
    the eyes outstart, curl, bloat, are newly baked

    and swaggering cookies of indignant light


III. GERT

    joggle i think will do it although the glad
    monosyllable jounce possibly can tell
    better how the balloons move (as
    her ghost lurks, a Beau Brummel sticking in its three-

    cornered always moist mouth)--jazz,
    for whose twitching lips, between you and me
    almost succeeds while toddle rings the bell.
    But if her tall corpsecoloured body seat
    itself (with the uncouth habitual dull
    jerk at garters) there’s no sharpest neat
    word for the thing.
                        Her voice?
                                  gruesome:a trull
    leaps from the lungs “gimme uh swell fite

    like up ter yknow, Rektuz, Toysday nite;
    where uh guy gets gayn troze uh lobstersalad


IV. MARJ

    “life?
          Listen” the feline she with radishred
    legs said (crossing them slowly)“I’m
    asleep. Yep. Youse is asleep kid
    and everybody is.” And i hazarded
    “god” (blushing slightly)--“O damn
    ginks like dis Gawd” opening slowlyslowly
    them--then carefully the rolypoly
    voice squatting on a mountain of gum did
    something like a whisper, “even her.”
    “The Madam?” I emitted; vaguely watching
    that mountainous worthy in the fragile act
    of doing her eyebrows.--Marj’s laughter smacked
    me: pummeling the curtains, drooped to a purr . . .

    i left her permanently smiling


V. FRAN

    should i entirely ask of god why
    on the alert neck of this brittle whore
    delicately wobbles an improbably distinct face,
    and how these wooden big two feet conclude
    happeningly the unfirm drooping bloated
    calves
          i would receive the answer more
    or less deserved, Young fellow go in peace.
    which i do, being as Dick Mid once noted
    lifting a Green River (here’s to youse)
    “a bloke wot’s well behaved” . . . and always try
    to not wonder how let’s say elation
    causes the bent eyes thickly to protrude--

    or why her tiniest whispered invitation
    is like a clock striking in a dark house

    nobody loses all the time

    i had an uncle named
    Sol who was a born failure and
    nearly everybody said he should have gone
    into vaudeville perhaps because my Uncle Sol could
    sing McCann He Was A Diver on Xmas Eve like Hell Itself which
    may or may not account for the fact that my Uncle

    Sol indulged in that possibly most inexcusable
    of all to use a highfalootin phrase
    luxuries that is or to
    wit farming and be
    it needlessly
    added

    my Uncle Sol’s farm
    failed because the chickens
    ate the vegetables so
    my Uncle Sol had a
    chicken farm till the
    skunks ate the chickens when

    my Uncle Sol
    had a skunk farm but
    the skunks caught cold and
    died and so
    my Uncle Sol imitated the
    skunks in a subtle manner

    or by drowning himself in the watertank
    but somebody who’d given my Uncle Sol a Victor
    Victrola and records while he lived presented to
    him upon the auspicious occasion of his decease a
    scrumptious not to mention splendiferous funeral with
    tall boys in black gloves and flowers and everything and

    i remember we all cried like the Missouri
    when my Uncle Sol’s coffin lurched because
    somebody pressed a button
    (and down went
    my Uncle
    Sol

    and started a worm farm)

Will i ever forget that precarious moment?

As i was standing on the third rail waiting for the next train to grind
me into lifeless atoms various ab- surd thoughts slyly crept into my
highly sexed mind.

It seemed to me that i had first of all really made quite a mistake
in being at all born, seeing that i was wifeless and only half awake,
cursed with pimples, correctly dressed, cleanshaven above the nombril,
and much to my astonishment much impressed by having once noticed (
as an infantile phenomenon ) George Washington almost incompletely
surrounded by well- drawn icecakes beheld being too strong, in brief
:an American, if you understand that i mean what i say i believe my
most intimate friends would never have gathered.

A collarbutton which had always not nothurt me not much and in the same
place.

Why according to tomorrow’s paper the proletariat will not rise
yesterday.

Inexpressible itchings to be photographed with Lord Rothermere playing
with Lord Rothermere billiards very well by moonlight with Lord
Rothermere.

A crockodile eats a native, who in revenge beats it insensible
with a banana, establishing meanwhile a re- ligious cult based on
consubstantial intangibility.

Personne ne m’aime et j’ai les mains froides.

His Royal Highness said “peek-a-boo” and thirty tame fleas left the
prettily embroidered howdah im- mediately.

Thumbprints of an angel named Frederick found on a lightning-rod,
Boston, Mass.

such were the not unhurried reflections to which my organ of
imperception gave birth to which i should or- dinarily have objected to
which, considering the back- ground, it is hardly surprising if anyone
hardly should call exactly extraordinary. We refer, of course, to my
position. A bachelor incapable of occupation, he had long suppressed
the desire to suppress the suppressed desire of shall we say: Idleness,
while meaning its opposite? Nothing could be clearer to all concerned
than that i am not a policeman.

Meanwhile the tea regressed.

Kipling again H. G. Wells, and Anatole France shook hands again and yet
again shook again hands again, the former coachman with a pipewrench
of the again latter then opening a box of newly without exaggeration
shot with some difficulty sardines. Mr. Wiggin took Wrs. Miggin’s harm
in is, extinguishing the spitoon by a candle furnished by courtesy of
the management on Thursdays, opposite which a church stood perfectly
upright but not piano item:a water- melon causes indigestion to William
Cullen Longfel- low’s small negro son, Henry Wordsworth Bryant.

By this time,however,the flight of crows had ceased. I withdrew my
hands from the tennisracket. All was over. One brief convulsive
octopus, and then our hero folded his umbrella.

It seemed too beautiful.

Let us perhaps excuse me if i repeat himself:these,or nearly these,were
the not unpainful thoughts which occupied the subject of our
attention;to speak even less objectively,i was horribly scared i would
actually fall off the rail before the really train after all arrived.
If i should have made this perfectly clear,it entirely would have been
not my fault.

    voices to voices, lip to lip
    i swear (to noone everyone) constitutes
    undying; or whatever this and that petal confutes. . .
    to exist being a peculiar form of sleep

    what’s beyond logic happens beneath will;
    nor can these moments be translated: i say
    that even after April
    by God there is no excuse for May

    --bring forth your flowers and machinery:sculpture and prose
    flowers guess and miss
    machinery is the more accurate, yes
    it delivers the goods, Heaven knows

    (yet are we mindful, though not as yet awake,
    of ourselves which shout and cling, being
    for a little while and which easily break
    in spite of the best overseeing)

    i mean that the blond absence of any program
    except last and always and first to live
    makes unimportant what i and you believe;
    not for philosophy does this rose give a damn. . .

    bring on your fireworks, which are a mixed
    splender of piston and of pistil; very well
    provided an instant may be fixed
    so that it will not rub, like any other pastel.

    (While you and i have lips and voices which
    are for kissing and to sing with
    who cares if some oneeyed son of a bitch
    invents an instrument to measure Spring with?

    each dream nascitur,is not made. . .)
    why then to Hell with that :the other; this,
    since the thing perhaps is
    to eat flowers and not to be afraid.

    it is winter a moon in the afternoon
    and warm air turning into January darkness up
    through which sprouting gently, the cathedral
    leans its dreamy spine against thick sunset

    i perceive in front of our lady a ring of people
    a brittle swoon of centrifugally expecting
    faces clumsily which devours a man, three cats,
    five white mice, and a baboon.

    O a monkey with a sharp face waddling carefully
    the length of this padded pole;a monkey attached
    by a chain securely to this always talking
    individual, mysterious witty hatless.

    Cats which move smoothly from neck to neck of bottles,cats
    smoothly willowing out and in between bottles,who step smoothly
    and rapidly along this pole over five squirming
    mice; or leap through hoops of fire,creating smoothness.

    People stare, the drunker applaud
    while twilight takes the sting out of the vermilion
    jacket of nodding hairy Jaqueline who is given a mouse
    to hold lovingly,

    our lady what do you think of this? Do your proud fingers and
    your arms tremble remembering something fragile
    and which had been presented unto you by a mystery?
    . . . the cathedral recedes into weather without answering

    Paris;this April sunset completely utters
    utters serenely silently a cathedral

    before whose upward lean magnificent face
    the streets turn young with rain,

    spiral acres of bloated rose
    coiled within cobalt miles of sky
    yield to and heed
    the mauve

    will out of the kindness of their hearts a few philosophers tell me
    what am i doing on top of this hill at Calchidas, in the sunlight?
    down ever so far on the beach below me a little girl in white
      spins,tumbles;rolling in sand.
    across this water,crowding tints:browns and whites showing,the dotting
      millions of windows of thousands of houses--Lisboa. Like the crackle
      of a typewriter,in the afternoon sky.
    goats and sheep are driven by somebody along a curve of road which
     eats into a pink cliff back and up leaning out of yellowgreen water.

    they are building a house down there by the sea,in the afternoon.

    rapidly a reddish ant travels my fifth finger.
    a bird chirps in a tree,somewhere nowhere
    and a little girl in white is tumbling
    in sand
           Clouds over
    me are like bridegrooms

    Naked and luminous

                        (here the absurd I; life, to peer and wear clothes.
      i am altogether foolish, i suddenly make a fist out of ten fingers

    perhaps that and this, deftly
    propping on smallest hands

    it’s five o’clock

    bulb of flame bubbles)

    sunlight was over
    our mouths fears hearts lungs arms hopes feet hands

    under us the unspeaking Mediterranean bluer
    than we had imagined
    a few cries drifting through
    high air
    a sail a fishing boat somebody an invisible spectator,
    maybe certain nobodies laughing faintly

    playing moving far below us

    perhaps one villa caught like pieces
    of a kite in the trees, here
    and here reflecting
    sunlight
    (everywhere sunlight keen complete
    silent

    and everywhere you your kisses your flesh mind breathing
    beside under around myself)
                               by and by

    a fat colour reared itself against the sky and the sea

    . . . finally your eyes knew
    me, we smiled to each other, releasing lay, watching
    (sprawling, in
    grass upon a
    cliff) what had been something
    else carefully slowly fatally turning into ourselves . . .

    while in the very middle of fire all

    the world becoming bright and little melted.

    the moon looked into my window
    it touched me with its small hands
    and with curling infantile
    fingers it understood my eyes cheeks mouth
    its hands(slipping)felt of my necktie wandered
    against my shirt and into my body the
    sharp things fingered tinily my heart life

    the little hands withdrew, jerkily, themselves

    quietly they began playing with a button
    the moon smiled she
    let go my vest and crept
    through the window
    she did not fall
    she went creeping along the air
                                   over houses
                                              roofs

    And out of the east toward
    her a fragile light bent gatheringly




II


    if being morticed with a dream
    myself speaks

    (whispering,
    suggesting that our souls
    inhabit whatever is between them)
    knowing my lips hands the way i move
    my habits laughter

    i say
    you will perhaps pardon,
    possibly you will comprehend.  and how
    this has arrived your mind may guess

    if at sunset
    it should, leaning against me, smile;
    or(between dawn and twilight)giving

    your eyes, present me also
    with the terror of shrines

    which noone has suspected(but
    wherein silently
    always
    are kneeling the various deaths
    which are your lover lady:together with what keen
    innumerable lives he has not lived.




III


    here’s a little mouse)and
    what does he think about, i
    wonder as over this
    floor(quietly with

    bright eyes)drifts(nobody
    can tell because
    Nobody knows, or why
    jerks Here &, here,
    gr(oo)ving the room’s Silence)this like
    a littlest
    poem a
    (with wee ears and see?

    tail frisks)
                    (gonE)
    “mouse”,
            We are not the same you and

    i, since here’s a little he
    or is
    it It
    ?   (or was something we saw in the mirror)?

    therefore we’ll kiss;for maybe
    what was Disappeared
    into ourselves
    who     (look).     ,startled




IV


    but if i should say
    goodmorning trouble adds
    up all sorts of quickly
    things on the slate of that
    nigger’s
    face(but

    If i should say thankyouverymuch

    mr rosenbloom picks strawberries
    with beringed hands)but if

    i Should say solong my
    tailor
    chuckles

    like a woman in a dream(but if i
    should say
    Now the all saucers
    but cups if begin to spoons dance every-

    should where say over the damned table and we
    hold lips Eyes everything
    hands you know what
    happens)but if i should,
    Say,




V


    in spite of everything
    which breathes and moves, since Doom
    (with white longest hands
    neatening each crease)
    will smooth entirely our minds

    --before leaving my room
    i turn, and(stooping
    through the morning)kiss
    this pillow, dear
    where our heads lived and were.




VI


    you are not going to, dear. You are not going to and
    i but that doesn’t in the least matter. The big
    fear Who held us deeply in His fist is

    no longer, can you imagine it
    i can’t which doesn’t matter
    and what does is possibly this dear, that we may resume
    impact with the inutile collide

    once more with the imaginable,love,and eat sunlight(do
    you believe it? i begin to and that doesn’t matter)which

    i suggest teach us a new terror always
    which shall brighten
    carefully these things we consider life.
    Dear i put my eyes into you but that doesn’t matter
    further than of old

    because you fooled the doctors,i touch you with hopesand
    words and with so and so: we are together, we will
    kiss or smile or move. It’s different too isn’t it

    different dear from moving as we, you
    and i,used to move when i thought you were going to(but
    that doesn’t matter)
    when you thought you were going to America.
                                                Then

    moving was a matter of not keeping still;we were
    two alert lice in the blond hair of nothing




VII


    since feeling is first
    who pays any attention
    to the syntax of things
    will never wholly kiss you;

    wholly to be a fool
    while Spring is in the world

    my blood approves,
    and kisses are a better fate
    than wisdom
    lady i swear by all flowers. Don’t cry
    --the best gesture of my brain is less than
    your eyelids’ flutter which says

    we are for each other: then
    laugh, leaning back in my arms
    for life’s not a paragraph

    And death i think is no parenthesis




VIII


    some ask praise of their fellows
    but i being otherwise
    made compose curves
    and yellows, angles or silences
    to a less erring end)

    myself is sculptor of
    your body’s idiom:
    the musician of your wrists;
    the poet who is afraid
    only to mistranslate

    a rhythm in your hair,
    (your fingertips
    the way you move)
                      the

    painter of your voice--
    beyond these elements

    remarkably nothing is. . . . therefore,lady
    am i content should any
    by me carven thing provoke
    your gesture possibly or

    any painting(for its own

    reason)in your lips
    slenderly should create one least smile
    (shyly
    if a poem should lift to
    me the distinct country of your
    eyes, gifted with green twilight)




IX


    supposing i dreamed this)
    only imagine, when day has thrilled
    you are a house around which
    i am a wind--

    your walls will not reckon how
    strangely my life is curved
    since the best he can do
    is to peer through windows, unobserved

    --listen, for(out of all
    things)dream is noone’s fool;
    if this wind who i am prowls
    carefully around this house of you

    love being such, or such,
    the normal corners of your heart
    will never guess how much
    my wonderful jealousy is dark

    if light should flower:
    or laughing sparkle from
    the shut house(around and around
    which a poor wind will roam




X


    you are like the snow only
    purer fleeter, like the rain
    only sweeter frailer you

    whom certain
    flowers ressemble but trembling(cowards
    which fear
    to miss within your least gesture the hurting
    skill which lives)and since

    nothing lingers
    beyond a little instant,
    along with rhyme and with laughter
    O my lady
    (and every brittle marvelous breathing thing)

    since i and you are on our ways to dust

    of your fragility
    (but chiefly of your smile,
    most suddenly which is
    of love and death a marriage)you give me

    courage
    so that against myself
    the sharp days slobber in vain:

    Nor am i afraid that
    this, which we call autumn, cleverly
    dies and over the ripe world wanders with
    a near and careful
    smile in his mouth(making

    everything suddenly old and with his awkward eyes
    pushing
    sleep under and thoroughly
    into all beautiful things)

    winter, whom Spring shall kill




XI


    because
    you go away i give roses who
    will advise even yourself, lady
    in the most certainly(of what we
    everywhere do not touch)deep
    things;
          remembering ever so
    tinily these, your crisp
    eyes actually shall contain new faeries

    (and if your slim lips are amused, no wisest

    painter of fragile
    Marys will understand
    how smiling may be made as
    skilfully.) But carry
    also, with that indolent and with
    this flower wholly whom you do
    not ever fear,
                me in your heart

    softly;not all
    but the beginning

    of mySelf




XII


    you being in love
    will tell who softly asks in love,

    am i separated from your body smile brain hands merely
    to become the jumping puppets of a dream? oh i mean:
    entirely having in my careful how
    careful arms created this at length
    inexcusable, this inexplicable pleasure--you go from several
    persons:believe me that strangers arrive
    when i have kissed you into a memory
    slowly, oh seriously
    --that since and if you disappear

    solemnly
    myselves
    ask “life, the question how do i drink dream smile

    and how do i prefer this face to another and
    why do i weep eat sleep--what does the whole intend”
    they wonder. ohandthey cry “to be,being,thatiamalive
    this absurd fraction in its lowest terms
    with everything cancelled
    but shadows
    --what does it all come down to? love? Love
    if you like and i like, for the reason that i
    hate people and lean out of this window is love,love
    and the reason that i laugh and breathe is oh love and the reason

    that i do not fall into this street is love.”




XIII


    Nobody wears a yellow
    flower in his buttonhole
    he is altogether a queer fellow
    as young as he is old

    when autumn comes,
    who twiddles his white thumbs
    and frisks down the boulevards

    without his coat and hat

    --(and i wonder just why that
    should please him or i wonder what he does)

    and why(at the bottom of this trunk,
    under some dirty collars)only a
    moment
    (or
    was it perhaps a year)ago i found staring

    me in the face a dead yellow small rose




XIV


    it is so long since my heart has been with yours

    shut by our mingling arms through
    a darkness where new lights begin and
    increase,
    since your mind has walked into
    my kiss as a stranger
    into the streets and colours of a town--

    that i have perhaps forgotten
    how, always(from
    these hurrying crudities
    of blood and flesh)Love
    coins His most gradual gesture,

    and whittles life to eternity

    --after which our separating selves become museums
    filled with skilfully stuffed memories




XV


    i am a beggar always
    who begs in your mind

    (slightly smiling, patient, unspeaking
    with a sign on his
    breast
    BLIND)yes i

    am this person of whom somehow
    you are never wholly rid(and who

    does not ask for more than
    just enough dreams to
    live on)
            after all, kid

    you might as well
    toss him a few thoughts

    a little love preferably,
    anything which you can’t
    pass off on other people: for
    instance a
    plugged promise--

    then he will maybe(hearing something
    fall into his hat)go wandering
    after it with fingers;till having

    found
    what was thrown away
                        himself
    taptaptaps out of your brain, hopes, life

    to(carefully turning a
    corner)never bother you any more.




XVI


    if within tonight’s erect
    everywhere of black muscles feels
    a weightless slowness(deftly

    muting the world’s texture with drifted

    gifts of featheriest slenderness and
    how gradually which descending are suddenly
    received)or by doomfull connivance

    accurately thither and hither myself

    struts unremembered(rememberingly
    with in both pockets curled hands moves)
    why then toward morning he is a ghost whom

    assault these whispering fists of hail

    (and a few windows awaken certain faces
    busily horribly blunder through new light
    hush we are made of the same thing as perhaps

    nothing, he murmurs carefully lying down)




XVII


    how this uncouth enchanted
    person, arising from a
    restaurant, looks breathes or moves
    --climbing(past light after
    light)to turn, disappears

    the very swift and
    invisibly living
    rhythm of your Heart possibly

    will understand;
    or why(in

    this most exquisite of cities)all
    of the long night a fragile imitation of
    (perhaps)myself carefully wanders
    streets dark and, deep

    with rain. . . .

    (he, slightly whom or
    cautiously this person

    and this imitation resemble,
    descends into the earth with the year
    a cigarette between his ghost-lips

    gradually)
    remembering badly, softly
    your
    kissed thrice suddenly smile




XVIII


    i go to this window

    just as day dissolves
    when it is twilight(and
    looking up in fear

    i see the new moon
    thinner than a hair)

    making me feel
    how myself has been coarse and dull
    compared with you, silently who are
    and cling
    to my mind always

    But now she sharpens and becomes crisper
    until i smile with knowing
    --and all about
    herself

    the sprouting largest final air

    plunges
          inward with hurled
    downward thousands of enormous dreams




FIVE




I


    after all white horses are in bed

    will you walking beside me, my very lady,
    if scarcely the somewhat city
    wiggles in considerable twilight

    touch (now) with a suddenly unsaid

    gesture lightly my eyes?
    And send life out of me and the night
    absolutely into me. . . . a wise
    and puerile moving of your arm will
    do suddenly that

                    will do
    more than heroes beautifully in shrill
    armour colliding on huge blue horses,
    and the poets looked at them, and made verses,

    through the sharp light cryingly as the knights flew.




II


    touching you i say (it being Spring
    and night) “let us go a very little beyond
    the last road--there’s something to be found”

    and smiling you answer “everything
    turns into something else, and slips away. . . .
    (these leaves are Thingish with moondrool
    and i’m ever so very little afraid”)
                                        i say
    “along this particular road the moon if you’ll
    notice follows us like a big yellow dog. You

    don’t believe? look back. (Along the sand
    behind us, a big yellow dog that’s . . . . now it’s red
    a big red dog that may be owned by who
    knows)
          only turn a little your. so. And

    there’s the moon,there is something faithful and mad”




III


    along the brittle treacherous bright streets
    of memory comes my heart,singing like
    an idiot, whispering like a drunken man

    who(at a certain corner, suddenly)meets
    the tall policeman of my mind.
                                    awake
    being not asleep, elsewhere our dreams began
    which now are folded:but the year completes
    his life as a forgotten prisoner

    --“Ici?”--“Ah non, mon cheri; il fait trop froid”--
    they are gone:along these gardens moves a wind bringing
    rain and leaves, filling the air with fear
    and sweetness. . . .pauses. (Halfwhispering. . . .halfsinging

    stirs the always smiling chevaux de bois)

    when you were in Paris we met here




IV


    our touching hearts slenderly comprehend
    (clinging as fingers, loving one another
    gradually into hands) and bend
    into the huge disaster of the year:

    like this most early single star which tugs

    weakly at twilight, caught in thickening fear
    our slightly fingering spirits starve and smother;
    until autumn abruptly wholly hugs

    our dying silent minds, which hand in hand
    at some window try to understand
    the
       (through pale miles of perishing air, haunted
    with huddling infinite wishless melancholy,
    suddenly looming) accurate undaunted

    moon’s bright third tumbling slowly




V


    if i have made,my lady,intricate
    imperfect various things chiefly which wrong
    your eyes(frailer than most deep dreams are frail)
    songs less firm than your body’s whitest song

    the sweet small clumsy feet of April came

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
